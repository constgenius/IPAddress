This project demonstrates how to fetch a user's IP address using JavaScript with the help of the ipify API. By making a simple HTTP request to the ipify service, developers can retrieve the public IP address of the user and display it on the web page. This is a great way to learn how to work with APIs, handle asynchronous data, and interact with external services in a frontend environment. It's a beginner-friendly example for understanding API integration using JavaScript.
